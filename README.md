# MEXICAN

This is a project for a JSON-api that reads and updates information about a local business called The Mexican Burrito in different platforms via its corresponding API.

We will be using Postgres as a db.

For testing we use RSpec, plus Shoulda matchers, and for the factories and its content factory-bot and ffaker.
